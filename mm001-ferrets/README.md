# Matching Mockups #001: Ferret & Holdings

## Standard Corporate Layout

In this activity, you'll be creating a corporate style home page. You should aim to make your version look as identical as possible to the provided version. Matching the given mockups with absolute 100% accuracy is not expected, however, you should prioritize the objectives listed below.

# Basic Objectives

- There should be a navigational header at the top of the page that stays fixed when you scroll
- There should be a three column layout of links on the bottom portion of the page
- The grid of corporate logos should not use `<table>`. When the width of the page is reduced, the logos should wrap to the next line.

# Fonts Used

The following fonts are available via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):

- **Raleway** - used for headers
- **Roboto** - used for the rest of the page content
